/*One difference between implementing Runnable and extending Thread is that by extending Thread, 
each of your threads has a unique object associated with it, 
whereas implementing Runnable, 
many threads can share the same object instance
 A Java Thread controls the main path of execution in an application. 
 When you invoke the Java Virtual Machine with the java command, 
 it creates an implicit thread in which to execute the main() method. 
 The Thread class provides a mechanism for the first thread to start-up 
 other threads to run in parallel with it.

 The Runnable interface defines a type of class that can be run by a thread. 
 The only method it requires is run(), which makes the interface very easy to fulfil by extending existing classes. 
 A runnable class may have custom constructors and any number of other methods for configuration and manipulation.
